= Backtrace Testing App

Native command-line app for Android. Android NDK is required for buiding.

Tests backtracing of native C code from a signal handler.

The following methods of backtracing are implmented:

* Using Android NDK's built-in libunwind with registers from `ucontext_t`
  (ARM32 only).
* Using `_Unwind_Backtrace()` function with registers from `ucontext_t`
  (ARM32 only).
* Using `_Unwind_Backtrace()` function with frame skipping
  (all architectures).

Implementation is in pure C, but some already-compiled C{plus}{plus} libraries
from Android NDK are used, such as libunwind and libc{plus}{plus}abi.
